## Dashboard For Hotels Company In Hospitality Domain
I'm excited to share my latest accomplishment - a Power BI Report project that I've just completed! This report is based on a hypothetical Hotels Company, AtliQ Hotels, to monitor various measures related to their business.
I learned so much from this project, such as Basic DAX functions, and I'm excited to apply my new skills and insights to future projects. Thanks to @codebasicshub for this project.


Dashboard Snapshots, PDF version and PBIX file is available in this repository. Feel free to download it, and add your visualizations to it. Don't forget to share it with me. LinkedIn, Instagram links are available on my website. Website link at the end !
